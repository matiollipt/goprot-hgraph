# Aid2GO: Automatic Protein Annotations using Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HANs)
Author: Cleverson Matiolli, Ph.D.

The vast amounts of genomic and proteomic data generated by high-throughput methods create a bottleneck in gene and protein annotation. Traditional methods based on sequence similarity and manual curation struggle with scalability and precision amidst the complexity of biological data. Here, we introduce Aid2GO, an innovative framework that encapsulates protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) and the Gene Ontology directed acyclic graph (GO DAG) into Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) to accurately predict protein annotations. Aid2GO generates embeddings for both protein features and GO term definitions, integrating them into a heterogeneous graph structure that models nuanced relationships within the data. The framework leverages these embeddings to propagate information through the network, enhancing node features with contextual information from both PPI and GO semantic relationships. Extensive validation demonstrates Aid2GO's effectiveness in predicting protein functions, showcasing significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of precision and scalability.
